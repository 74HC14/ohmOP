### Free Software Tools:
[Wikipedia list comparing simulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_free_electronics_circuit_simulators) <br>
[Wikipedia list comparing EDA tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_EDA_software) <br>
[Wikipedia list comparing CAD tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_computer-aided_design_software)

#### Recommended Simulators:
LTspice - Quick to use simulator with a decent catalog of parts, closed source <br>
Qucs-S - Possibly better than LTspice, requires NGspice, open source <br>
QucsStudio - Possibly better than Qucs-S, windows/wine, closed source <br>
KiCAD - Has a simulator that runs on NGspice internally, open source <br>
MicroCap - Formerly paid software, windows/wine, closed source <br>
Logisim Evolution - Only for digital circuits, can simulate entire breadboard computers, open source <br>

#### Recommended EDA Tools:
KiCAD - Good, big catalog of parts, can make scripts and addons, open source <br>
Altium Circuitmaker - Apparently good, windows/wine, closed source <br>
EasyEDA - Web-based and bloaty, makes JLC fabrication and assembly easier, closed source <br>
LibrePCB - Apparently good, open source <br>

#### Recommended CAD Tools:
FreeCAD - Can be clunky, the Realthunder and Onsdel forks may be better, can export models to KiCAD, open source <br>
OpenSCAD - Programming-based, can't chamfer, open source <br>
Fusion 360 - Good, free license is increasingly limited, closed source <br>
OnShape - Good, web-based, free license means all files are public, closed source <br>
Sketchup Make 2017 - Shit but simple, just works bro, closed source <br>
QCAD - 2D only, good, need to pay for certain file exports, open source <br>

### Component sourcing:
[Adafruit page of hobbyist/surplus parts stores](https://ladyada.net/library/procure/hobbyist.html)

#### Recommended Component Vendors:
Octopart - Searches through multiple vendors, more powerful parametric search, but can get confused with different vendors' data formats <br>
Mouser, Digi-Key, Arrow, Farnell, RS - Whichever has a warehouse closer to you will mean cheaper shipping <br>
LCSC - Chinese version of Digi-Key, stock a lot of western parts, but also a bunch of unique chinese parts you won't see anywhere else <br>
eBay/AliExpress sellers - fakes are not uncommon, beware when buying all but the most jellybean ICs <br>
Local shop - will be far more expensive with very limited stock, but more convenient, and may be worth designing around <br>
