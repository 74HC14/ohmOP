# Projects By Category

These projects are intended to be built by a user who understands their operation, ideally by designing the circuit themselves after research into existing circuits. This isn't really possible for radio circuits because they're magic.

**Project-centric Categories:** <br>
These are fields that entire projects are based around, here are some projects for various skill levels:
| Category | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced |
|---|---|---|---|
| Power | linear transformer PSU <br> bang-bang switcher <br> brushed motor PWM | CC/CV linear PSU <br> variable duty-cycle switcher <br> H-bridge motor driver | relay-ranging linear PSU <br> isolated SMPS <br> BLDC driver|
| Audio | elektrosluch <br> class-A amp <br> distortion effect | string or drum synth <br> class-AB amp <br> wah pedal | polyphonic synth <br> class-D amp <br> live programmable pedal |
| Radio | crystal / foxhole radio <br> pixie transceiver <br> AM / FM transmitter | superhet receiver <br> RS232-RTTY interface <br> metal detector with phase | diy SDR <br> moonbounce hardware <br> doppler radar |
| Instrumentation | milliohm meter <br> current clamp <br> curve tracer | LCR meter <br> seismometer <br> differential probe | good LTZ1000 reference <br> 0.1-10Hz amplifier <br> peltier temp regulator |
| Electromagnetic | flip-dots <br> fake overunity machine <br> mechanical rectifier | multistage coil-gun <br> analog clock <br> punch-card reader | magnetic levitator <br> 5 axis robot arm <br> NC machine |
