# Projects By Category

These projects are intended to be built by a user who understands their operation, ideally by designing the circuit themselves after research into existing circuits.
The above isn't really possible for radio circuits because they're magic.

**Project-centric Categories:**

**Instrumental Categories:**


>embedded (programming MCUs): something with a sensor and screen and maybe a rotary encoder

>DSP (analogue circuits, but digital)

>control theory (feedback loops)

>PCB fabrication (routing or etching)

>enclosure fabrication (3D printing or otherwise)

>micropower
