# Projects By Category

These projects are intended to be built by a user who understands their operation, ideally by designing the circuit themselves after research into existing circuits.
The difficulty levels are arbitrary.

**Project-centric Categories:**

| Category | Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced |
|---|---|---|---|
| Power | linear transformer PSU <br> bang-bang buck / boost <br> brushed motor PWM | CC/CV linear PSU <br> variable duty-cycle buck / boost <br> H-bridge motor driver | relay-ranging linear transformer PSU <br> isolated SMPS <br> BLDC driver|
| Audio | elektrosluch <br> class-A amp <br> distortion effect | string or drum synth <br> class-AB amp <br> wah pedal | polyphonic synth <br> class-D amp <br> live audio FFT pedal |

>power (power supplies, both linear and switching, and strange resonant topologies): linear adjustable-voltage or current power supply, 555 timer fixed-duty-cycle boost converter, motor driver

>audio (amps, synths, effects pedals): elektrosluch, stereo summing amplifier for audio mixing, transistor amplifier

>radio (antennas, transmitters, receivers): crystal/foxhole radio, some sort of powered AM receiver, monolithic resonator-based AM transmitter, pixie

>instrumentation (precision sensing and datalogging): ohmmeter, LCR meter, frequency counter, curve tracer, something using one of those voltmeter ICs

>electromechanical (jukeboxes, cassette players)

>discrete logic (retro computers and little else): mains frequency clock, traffic light controller, synth sequencer

>unconventional bullshit (circuit bending): solder LDRs into a fisher price sound toy, make a reverse bias BJT oscillator, use digital ICs for analog signals


**Instrumental Categories:**



>embedded (programming MCUs)
>something with a sensor and screen and maybe a rotary encoder
>DSP (analogue circuits, but digital)
>control theory (feedback loops)
>PCB fabrication (routing or etching)
>enclosure fabrication (3D printing or otherwise)
